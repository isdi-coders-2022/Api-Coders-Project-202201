## Cocktails the drink experience

# Greetings

Hellow there code enthusiast , this is the official repo of
Cocktails "The drinking experience".

The main idea of this project is to give options to the user
to explore all kinds of drinks and try out new ones.

# Ussage

In the homepage you can see 11 categories to narrow your search and
find faster your dream drink.

You can add your favorite drinks to "My Bar" page by simply touching the star icon, and your your own in the form page.

# Tech stack

Being this webpage a React-based project we don't use extra technologies to build the webpage.It's made with flux architecture , react native hooks and react contexts.

We used the technologies listed before because of the high demand in the
industry and their advantages managing information in comparison to an MVC.

To run the project it's as easy as clone this repo and install the npm packages.
